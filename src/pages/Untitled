Read the Figma link and Dev Mode / plugin output I already shared carefully.
Your task is to CLONE the design EXACTLY as shown in Figma — pixel-perfect.
This is NOT an approximation. This is a 1:1 implementation.

✅ Strict Requirements (Must Follow All)

Framework & Stack

Use React.js (functional components only)

Use Tailwind CSS only (NO inline styles, NO CSS files)

Assume Tailwind is already installed and configured

Layout Accuracy (Very Important)

Match exact spacing, padding, margin, width, height, and alignment

Follow the same grid / masonry / column structure used in Figma

Respect auto-layout rules from Figma (row, column, gap, alignment)

Do NOT “simplify” layouts — replicate them

Sizing & Units

Convert Figma pixel values directly into Tailwind values
(e.g. w-[327px], gap-[12px], rounded-[16px])

Do NOT replace exact sizes with flex-1, w-full, or approximations unless Figma uses them

Typography

Match font family, size, weight, line-height, letter-spacing

Use exact Tailwind equivalents or arbitrary values

Text alignment must match exactly (left / center / right)

Colors & Effects

Use exact HEX/RGBA colors from Figma

Implement:

shadows

gradients

borders

opacity

Use Tailwind arbitrary values if needed

Images & Icons

Use the same image aspect ratios

Match image sizes exactly

Preserve rounded corners and overlays

If image URLs are not available, use placeholders but keep dimensions exact

Responsiveness

First implement desktop exactly

Then add responsive behavior only if it exists in Figma

Do NOT invent breakpoints or layouts

Component Structure

Break UI into clean reusable components only if it matches Figma sections

Keep component names meaningful (HeroSection, StatsCard, etc.)

No over-engineering

Code Output Rules

Provide:

Full React component code

Tailwind classes inline

No explanations unless asked

The UI rendered in browser should look identical to Figma screenshot

Validation

Before finalizing, visually compare the output with Figma

If anything differs in spacing, size, or alignment — fix it
